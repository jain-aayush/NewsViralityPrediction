# News Virality Prediction. 

<li>I am using the Online News Popularity dataset to create a Machine Learning model to predict the estimated virality of a news article.
<li>The number of times an article gets shared is used as the measure of its virality, i.e, if an article is shared more, it is more likely to be viral. 

# Packages used
For the accomplishment of this project, I have:
<li>Used scrapy to crawl the Times of India website and extract information from the articles
<li>Used Newspaper3k package to extract the article contents and to find the keywords associated with the article
<li>Used Xgboost and Tensorflow to create Machine Learning Models.
<li>Used TextBlob library for extracting sentiment and polarity.
<li>Used sklearn for preprocessing.
<li>Pandas and Numpy for working with dataframes and handling computations.
